  <h5><b>1.Search Engine Optimization</b></h5>
  <h6>The practise of optimising your website in order to boost its exposure when people search for it in search engines is known as SEO. You'll need useful insights and assistance at every level of any project or work you've started. To increase your website's visibility, you'll also need targeted SEO. The best SEO company in Delhi, Fazli Company, offers the best services for your business.</h6>
  <h6><b>How does SEO work?</b></h6>
  <h6>Google, Yahoo, Bing, and other search engines seek to give the greatest services to their users. Bots are used by these search engines to crawl websites, move from site to site, collect information about specific topics, and index it.</h6>
  <h6>The algorithms examine the pages in an index, taking into account the ranking parameters, to decide the page order in which they should appear for a given search.</h6>
  <h6>Search Engines have spiders. These spiders collect all the information about your website and also what the person is searching for and which website is suitable for them. They gather information like page speed, title tags, backlinks, and other factors.</h6>
  <h6>You can't pay search engines to increase your website's visibility, so SEO experts must put in the effort.</h6>
  <h6><b>Keyword Resarch</b></h6>
  <h6>The initial stage in the Search Engine Optimization procedure is keyword research (SEO). The process of locating and analyzing actual words that people are searching for on search engines is known as keyword research. It is usually beneficial to understand the keywords that boost the visibility of the website while creating your SEO strategy. Also, analyze our competitors' keywords and compare them to our own to determine the most commonly searched.</h6>
  <h6><b>Links </b></h6>
  <h6>from other websites play an important part in determining a site's position in Google and other search engines.</h6>
  <h6><b>Page Structure</b></h6>
  <h6>One of the major components of SEO is Page Structure. Because webpages are written in HTML, the structure of the HTML code can affect how a search engine evaluates a page.</h6>
  <br></br>

  <h5><b>2.Search Engine Marketing</b></h5>
  <h6>The use of paid adverts on search engines to boost traffic to a website is known as search engine marketing (SEM). SEM campaigns are controlled through paid advertising, such as Google Adwords or Bing Ads. When someone searches for something they sell, such as "top cafes in Delhi," the goal is for businesses to appear at the top of the page.</h6>
  <h6>Search engine marketing, or SEM, is a terrific technique to help your business acquire more consumers and make more cash. You can improve the quantity of people that come to your website from search engines by using SEM.</h6>
  <h6>We'll go through how to improve your website's visibility in search engine results pages, or SERPs, in this post. Pay-per-click advertising and search engine optimization are the two most used methods. Pay-per-click (PPC) advertising is a quick way to bring your adverts to the top of Google's first page for certain searches for a predetermined cost per click.</h6>
  <h6><b>How Does SEM work?</b></h6>
  <h6>SEM, or search engine marketing, consists of three fundamental strategies: keyword targeting, traffic purchase, and the use of your website to increase exposure. Increasing the exposure of your website will help you generate more money by attracting new clients who would not have found you otherwise. You may also employ a search engine marketing (SEM) firm to handle the work for you.</h6>
  <h6>Businesses pay for adverts to display as search results on the search engine results page via Search Engine Marketing (SERPS). To appear in the SERPs, they use precise keywords in their adverts. When a person searches for such terms, they are presented with an advertisement from that brand. The particular brand is paid if a user clicks on the ad.</h6>
  <br></br>

  <h5><b>3.Social Media Marketing</b></h5>
  <h6>Increased social media following is one of the most effective techniques to raise brand recognition for market items. However, success on social media demands a lot of effort and perseverance. Right now, our firm, Fazli Company, can assist you with our Social Media Marketing Services to help you improve your brand image and market share.</h6>
